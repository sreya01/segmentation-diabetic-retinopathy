Lesion-Guided Deep Learning for Diabetic Retinopathy Detection

This is the repo for the diabetic retinopathy symptom detection and classification project. We primarily used Kaggle to train and test the architectures, using the INDIAN DIABETIC RETINOPATHY IMAGE DATASET which can be found here: Kaggle([www.google.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aaryapatel98/indian-diabetic-retinopathy-image-dataset/code))
The repo primarily consists of UNET with efficientB4 and efficientB0, and LinkNet with EfficientNetB0 backbones. Additional FPN architecture was trained, but not pursued durther due to overfitting.
Model weights used for testing has also been uploaded.
